                    <h2>What You Are Looking For?</h2>
                    <p>There are many different types of buildings available for purchase or rent. Residential
                        buildings, such as apartments, townhouses, and single-family homes, are popular choices for
                        those seeking a place to live. Commercial buildings such as office buildings, retail spaces, and
                        warehouses, are available for businesses looking for a place to operate. Industrial buildings,
                        such as manufacturing facilities and distribution centers, are designed for heavy-duty
                        operations. Mixed-use buildings, which combine residential and commercial spaces, are also
                        becoming increasingly popular. In addition, there are specialised buildings such as healthcare
                        facilities, educational institutions, and recreational facilities that cater to specific needs.
                        Ultimately, the type of building that is bes for you will depend on your unique requirements and
                        the intended use of the property.</p>
